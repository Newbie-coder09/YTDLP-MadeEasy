# YTDLP-MadeEasy
A shell script that works on Yt-Dlp but with easy to remember commands and essential features.

## What is it?:
This is a shell script written to solve the problem of remembering YT-DLP commands that are very hard to remember. You can use this shell script to perform all the essential functions of YT-DLP (All features will be added soon). This script was originally developed for a different project, but that project failed so, we released this separately.

## Features:
* Easy to remember codes.
* Downloads the video where this file is located.
* Works in both Windows and Linux.
* Has all important features of YT-DLP.

## Requirements:
This program will automatically install YT-DLP upon running the check command:

  sh script.sh Check
